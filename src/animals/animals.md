# Inheritance and Polymorphism Bonus

Create an abstract class of Animal

- add the following fields:
    - ```private int numberOfLegs```
    - ```private String prefferedClimate```
    - ```abstract String getAnimalInfo()```: a method that returns a message with number of legs and preferrered climate info
- add getters and setters
- add a constructor that sets all properties

Create a class of Dog, Fish, Cat that extends Animal

- add additional private properties that are unique to each specific animal type and getters and setters for these properties
- overload the getAnimalInfo() to invoke the parent getAnimalInfo() method and return extra info on all the additional properties for the specific animal type
- add a constructor that invokes the parent constructor and sets new properties

Create AnimalApp.java inside package animals (if you haven't already)
Create an Animal variable and assign it a Dog, pass the appropriate arguments
Print to the console the return value of that instance's getAnimalInfo()
Do the same for Cat and Fish
